------------------------ TCLFire ------------------------
 
TCLFire is an adaptation of the FirePHP API to TCL. It allows sending 
debugging information to the browsers console and supports commonly 
used tcl data types. 

TCLFire requires the Browser Extensions “Firebug”/“Chrome Developer Tools” 
and and at least tcl 8.5 to work.
 
TCLFire has been developed to work with ]project-open[ (http://www.project-open.org), 
an Open Source Project Management System that is build on top of the 
OpenACS Framework (http://www.openacs.org/). 
 
Currently available debugging techniques for OpenACS provide debugging 
information either right on the screen or in a log file. Screen output is 
not always desired or possible and might corrupt the presentation. 
Output to the logfile needs to be extracted using OS tools such as cat, 
tail, grep or other applications and system tools.  
 
Using TCLFire, debugging data is added to the HTML Protocol Header and
can be conveniently visualized by Browser AddOn’s mentioned above. 
Multidimensional data structures can be conveniently viewed using the 
“digg-in” features of the AddOn’s mentioned above.
 
TCLFire in its current version runs with Google Chrome and FF. 
Suggestions and other improvements by the community are welcome.
